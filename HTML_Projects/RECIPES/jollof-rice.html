      <div class="directions">
        <ol>
          <li>
            Combine tomato, red bell pepper, habanero pepper, Fresno chili (or
            jalapeño), garlic, ginger, and water in a blender for the sauce.
            Blend on high until smooth and set aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and salt
            and sauté until the onion starts to soften (4 to 5 minutes). Clear
            space in the middle of the pan, add tomato paste, and sauté for 2 to
            3 minutes. Season with paprika, curry powder, cumin, thyme, pepper,
            and turmeric; continue cooking for 1 to 2 minutes until everything
            is well combined.
          </li>
          <li>
            Turn off the heat, and stir in the rice, making sure every grain of
            rice is coated with the oil-tomato mixture. Add bay leaf and chicken
            bouillon paste.
          </li>
          <li>
            Turn heat to high, stir in tomato sauce, and bring to a vigorous
            simmer. Cover with a tight fitting lid, reduce heat to medium-low,
            and simmer for 20 minutes. Do not remove the lid or stir rice.
          </li>
          <li>
            Turn off heat after 20 minutes, and set the timer for 12 minutes.
            Allow rice to sit and do not remove the lid.
          </li>
          <li>
            After the 12 minutes are up, remove lid, and fluff rice with a fork,
            separating all the grains. Serve garnished with green onions and
            chopped cilantro (optional).
